# babymonitor

A Raspberry Pi based baby monitor

[![Build Status](https://snap-ci.com/baby-tech/babymonitor/branch/master/build_image)](https://snap-ci.com/baby-tech/babymonitor/branch/master)

## Purpose

A tool to allow monitoring of your baby, even at night. Based on the NOIR camera and a Raspberry Pi.

## Doing dev away from a Raspberry Pi

You can do _some_ development without being on the Raspberry Pi. Make sure you have [ImageMagick](http://www.imagemagick.org/) installed and run:

    npm install
    node stubs/app.js
